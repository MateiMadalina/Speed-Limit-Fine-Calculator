# Speed-Limit-Fine-Calculator

### Description

This project is a Java console application designed to help a transportation company calculate fines for drivers who exceed the speed limit. The application prompts the user to input the vehicle type, road type, and vehicle speed, and then calculates the corresponding fine.

### Functionality

- The application supports three types of vehicles: cars, buses, and trucks.
- Speed limit values vary depending on the vehicle type and road type (urban areas, main roads, highways).
- Upon user input, the application calculates the fine based on the entered vehicle type, road type, and speed.
- The application follows architectural principles, including the Single Responsibility Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Injection, logging of operations, and Clean Code Principles.
